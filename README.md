## ALX SPECIALIZATION

### Congratulations to me on making it to specialization!
- Feels good to know that in only three months I will become a Certified ALX Software Engineer?

- In these last 3 months, I will be exploring my selected specialization deeper

#### What is our Graduation Criteria?

#### How can I access my Specialization projects?


- For the next 3 months, keep an eye on the “my code progress”

- My first projects are already available on the github for you to work on.

- Absolutely! In the Specialization phase, I will gain new technical skills with all the technical expertise I may need in this phase.
I wish myself all the best and can not wait to see me at graduation!

## Thanks to the ALX SE Programme Team.
